abstract: "Simulation-to-reality transfer remains a key challenge in robotic learning. We present a systematic approach for training mobile manipulation policies in simulation and successfully deploying them on real robots. Our method includes domain randomization, realistic physics simulation, and progressive fine-tuning strategies that enable robust real-world performance."
