abstract: "We explore the application of large vision-language models for robotic task planning in domestic environments. By fine-tuning pre-trained models on robotic demonstration data, we enable robots to understand natural language instructions and generate executable action sequences. Our approach bridges the gap between high-level human commands and low-level robot control."
