abstract: "We present a novel approach for learning robust manipulation policies for deformable objects using deep reinforcement learning. Our method combines visual perception with force-torque feedback to enable robots to handle soft materials in unstructured environments. We demonstrate that our approach achieves 95% success rate on a variety of manipulation tasks including folding, grasping, and assembly of deformable materials."

## Overview

This work addresses the challenging problem of robotic manipulation of deformable objects, which has applications in manufacturing, healthcare, and home assistance.

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel representation**: We introduce a compact state representation that captures the essential properties of deformable objects
2. **Efficient learning**: Our method requires 50% fewer training samples compared to prior work
3. **Real-world validation**: Demonstrated on a physical robot system with various materials

## Results

Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods across multiple metrics:
- Success rate: 95% vs 78% (baseline)
- Task completion time: 15s vs 22s (baseline)
- Generalization to novel objects: 87% vs 62% (baseline)
